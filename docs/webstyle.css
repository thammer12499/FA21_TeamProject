/*  ebb: These are CSS comments! The following rules style the "picture frame" HTML elements 
 * and help control image size in a way that scales. We made the figure element be 30% of the width of the page.
 * Then we controlled the width of the image **inside** the picture frame of the <figure>: it's allowed to fill 100% of the figure element, but can't get larger than 300 pixels.
 * You can give any element a background-color property, so we are showing how to do it here.  */
